      <h2>Android Master Race</h2>
      <p>
        This webpage is dedicated to android and the android open source project. 
        This is why android is better than apple even though I dont care. I had no ideas on the the next page so a friend told me to do this.
        While some people are quite content with the homogeneity offered by iOS, those of us who like to see a phone as an extension of ourselves want to tweak it. 
        You can even completely replace the software on some Android devices.
        Android devices let you change just about every aspect of their on-screen appearance â€“ from the keyboard, 
        to the homescreen launcher, to your email app. If you get CyanogenMod, 
        you can pretty much strip away any unnecessary features that come pre-loaded on your phone.
        On this page you will find useful informaiton
        about android and gaining root access to your phone. 
        I will also provide information for development, and helpful
        links to mods/hacks.
